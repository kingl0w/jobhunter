**Updated by:** _verifier (automated) or human (on hotfix)_

This file is the project's short-term memory. Every subagent reads it first. Only the verifier writes it during the loop; humans write it on out-of-loop edits.

## Current focus

_One sentence. What is the single most important thing in flight right now? If you can't fit it in one sentence, you're focused on too many things._

## Queue

Tickets ready to be worked, in rough priority order. The planner picks the top one on `/next` unless told otherwise.

- _none_

## In progress

Tickets currently being executed by the loop or paused mid-cycle. At most one per operator.

- [ ] _none_

## Done this cycle

Tickets completed since the last cycle close. Cleared when you close a cycle (weekly, by default). Append-only within a cycle.

- 2026-04-24 — [JH-001](tickets/JH-001-readme-gemini-api-key.md) — Fix README API key drift: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → GEMINI_API_KEY (P3)

## Open decisions

Product or architecture calls that are pending and block one or more queued tickets. Each becomes an ADR once decided.

- _none_

## Known drift

Places the code and `argos/specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` disagree. Each entry should name the file or module, one sentence on the mismatch, and a disposition (fix code, update docs, file ADR).

- _none_
