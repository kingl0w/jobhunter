# ADR-000 — Example: choosing a persistence layer for jobhunter

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Proposed
**Deciders:** _you_

This is the template ADR. Copy it to `ADR-NNN-short-slug.md` (next unused number), fill in the sections, and flip Status to Accepted once the decision lands. Once Accepted, an ADR is immutable — supersede it with a new ADR rather than editing.

## Context

_The situation that requires a decision. Include: what problem is being solved, what constraints apply, what has already been ruled out and why. Two to four paragraphs. Someone reading this a year from now should be able to reconstruct the decision without asking you._

This example ADR imagines that jobhunter needs to persist state between runs and the team is choosing between three reasonable options. The decision is non-trivial because the project's long-term shape — does it stay single-node? does it need search? does it need transactions? — is not yet settled.

## Options

### Option A — SQLite (embedded, file-backed)

**Pros:**
- Zero operational overhead; ships inside the binary.
- Transactions, indexes, and SQL familiarity.
- Trivial to back up (copy the file).

**Cons:**
- Single-writer concurrency model limits future horizontal scaling.
- No built-in replication; HA story is nontrivial.
- Schema migrations in production require care.

### Option B — Postgres (managed, networked)

**Pros:**
- Full-featured SQL, strong concurrency, proven at scale.
- Managed offerings handle backup, failover, point-in-time recovery.
- Rich ecosystem (extensions, tooling, observability).

**Cons:**
- Requires running a service; adds deploy complexity for a v1.
- Cost floor even at zero traffic.
- Over-engineered for the current load profile.

### Option C — JSON files on disk

**Pros:**
- Simplest possible thing.
- Trivially inspectable, diffable, version-controllable.
- Zero dependencies.

**Cons:**
- No concurrency guarantees; corruption on concurrent writes.
- No query capability beyond "load the whole file."
- Will need to be thrown away the moment a second process touches the data.

## Recommendation

_The author's recommendation, with a one-sentence justification that references the Context. This is not yet The Decision — the user gets to accept, reject, or pick a different option._

For a single-node v1 with low write concurrency and an unclear scaling trajectory, **Option A (SQLite)** is the recommendation: it gets you transactions and SQL without the operational cost of Postgres, and it's easy to migrate off if Option B becomes necessary.

## Decision

_Filled in by the user. Record the chosen option and any modifications. Date the decision. Once this section is filled and Status is Accepted, the ADR is frozen._

_To be filled by user._

## Consequences

_What changes as a result of this decision? What becomes easier? What becomes harder? What is now off the table? What new work is implied (schema design, migration tooling, a new dependency in the manifest)? This section is the contract with future-you._

- _To be filled once Decision is made._
